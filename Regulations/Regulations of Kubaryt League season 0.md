## 5. Restarts

5.1 Red is the first that has to decide if they take a restart, blue is second. (If blue passes turn intending to take a restart, in order to not give it away, and then red does not take restart and ends turn, blue has to write 111 in the first 5 seconds after accepting his turn. After that time, blue has to play the map).

5.2 The players can take technical restarts. Technical restarts are available if the map is bugged, there is no passage to the next zone, there is no town in the starting zone, or when the map is blocked by a powerful guard making it impossible to explore the map or develop. This needs to be the case on 111 or 112. Only a judge can decide about a technical restart.

5.3 Technical restarsts can be used from 111 to 114 inclusive. If players can't reach an agreement about technical restart, decision must be consultated with the **Judge**

5.4 Early meeting restarts. If players interact with each other in early turns, each of them has the right to ask for a technical restart. The last day on which that is allowed is 116. Interaction between players is defined as any battle between players, or taking over any object belonging to another player (empty mines, towns, etc.). Bear in mind, if simultaneous turns get interrupted, that does not mean an interaction happened. If by the time Blue finishes their turn, there was no interaction, there are no grounds for technical reset.

## 6. Fair play rules

6.1 Do not use crashes for your advantage. If the game is re-loaded due to a crash, the players should do their best to recreate their moves on the adventure map and in combat in the turn in which error occurred. If a judge decides that moves were not repeated faithfully enough, they can ask players to reload again. If a player purposely changed his moves to gain an advantage, the organiser can punish them with a technical loss. If after loading the game a player has more time than before, they should spend that excess with their town or hero screen open - not analyzing the game or playing. In case of low timer these actions could result in an undeserved advantage.

6.2 External help. There are many ways of getting additional information useful in an ongoing game. Below is a list of them, with a decision whether or not it’s acceptable:
